# Bolus Calculator

This calculator is to aid people with diabetes in dosing descisions for their mealtime insulin.

It allows you to fetch your current glucose data from the dexcom servers and uses this to calculate a correction dose which is used in addition to your meal data to calculate the dose which will bring you to your target value.

Can also be used without Dexcom data but wont calculate a correction if current glucose is not provided.
